React-redux - Implimentation 
Redux - core library

Step 1 - Create a Store(uasally one store for each app)-Single source of truth

configureStore from redux-toolkit

introduce (reducers) by creating this, creata a features, and create a Slice from redux-toolkit

by creating a Slice,you need 3 things

1. CreateSlice
2. initialState
3. list of resucers

reducer is an object : {

	addTodo : (state, action) // state - updated state value in the store
				  // action - action.payload


}


and after that, export all your resucers individually note that every reducers must be export

and alos the main source of your reducers


and in your components, you just think about that, dispatch and select by usinhg useDispatch and useSelector from 'react-redux'

useDispatch()

useSelctor(state => state.todo) like you have access for callback and select wherever you want
